      <h4>The Story</h4>
      <p>
        I was constantly writing on different things - such as wordpress, twitter, my journal,
        notes on iphone and even random paper. If I needed to find a note I wrote down, chances are 
        I wouldn't be able to find it.
        <br>
        <br>

        As I was noticing this trend I was currently working on another app. One that would help you reflect on life every week, month and year. It would be a reminder to 
        sit and be remembered of your life. This is a life tool that I picked up a few years ago, but 
        has always been difficult to stay consistent. 
        <br>
        <br>

        I worked on this life review reminder application for quite some time, talked to a few people
        about it, and eventually stopped working on it. Just like many of my other projects. 
        <br>
        <br>

        About half a year later, I still desired to have something similar and started to rethink my 
        approach. This is when Reflect Simple was born.
        <br>
        <br>

        The idea is this, a web and ios app that is two things. One, a non distracting way to take notes, thoughts and blog posts and categorize them so I can easily find them later as well as
        post to some of my favorite social media outlets. And two, a way to reflect on that I have 
        written. I decided to create a book out of my notes. Then when I receive the book in the 
        mail, I simply sit down and read it, reflect and grow.
        <br>
        <br>

        This tool I hope to be helpful to many. As I continue to build it and work out the details, 
        <a href="#stay">sign up</a> and stay in the loop.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>

        Thanks for reading!
        <br>
        Chris
